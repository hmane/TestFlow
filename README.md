# Legal Workflow System

An automated legal review and compliance workflow system built as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Form Customizer extension. Streamlines legal and compliance review processes for marketing communications with centralized tracking, automated routing, and complete audit trails.

## Overview

The Legal Review System (LRS) replaces manual email-based workflows with an integrated SharePoint solution that provides:
- **Automated Routing**: Direct assignment or committee-based attorney assignment
- **Centralized Tracking**: Real-time status tracking with workflow visualization
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All actions, approvals, and reviews are logged
- **Document Management**: Integrated document upload and approval file tracking
- **Dual Review Support**: Legal and Compliance review paths
- **Role-Based Access**: Item-level permissions managed via Azure Functions

## Workflow Overview

### Request Statuses
1. **Draft** - User creates request
2. **Legal Intake** - Legal Admin triages
3. **Assign Attorney** (optional) - Committee or direct assignment
4. **In Review** - Legal and/or Compliance review
5. **Closeout** - Submitter enters tracking info, acknowledges comments
6. **Awaiting FINRA Documents** - Pending FINRA letter upload (if required)
7. **Completed** - Request finalized

**Special Statuses**: Cancelled, On Hold

### User Roles
- **LW - Submitters**: Create and view requests
- **LW - Legal Admin**: Triage and assign
- **LW - Attorney Assigner**: Committee members
- **LW - Attorneys**: Review assigned requests
- **LW - Compliance Users**: Compliance reviews
- **LW - Admin**: Full system administration

### Dashboard Views (19 total)

Views are organized by user role with appropriate fields and sorting:

| Category | Views |
|----------|-------|
| **Home** | My Open Requests, My Completed Requests, My Awaiting FINRA Documents |
| **Admin** | All Open Requests, All Completed Requests, All Requests |
| **Legal Admin** | Legal Intake Queue, Pending Attorney Assignment, All In Review |
| **Attorney** | My Assigned Requests, Pending My Review, My Completed Reviews |
| **Attorney Assigner** | Awaiting Attorney Assignment |
| **Compliance** | Pending Compliance Review, Completed Compliance Reviews |
| **Closeout** | Closeout Queue |
| **FINRA** | Awaiting FINRA Documents |
| **Special** | On Hold Requests, Rush Requests |

**Note**: Rush requests are visually indicated with a red left border (row formatter) instead of a separate column.

### Field Customizers

Custom column renderers for enhanced list view experience:

| Extension | Column | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Request ID** | Title | Clickable link with hover card showing request details, "NEW" badge for items < 48 hours old |
| **Request Status** | Status | Progress bar with color-coded fill based on workflow stage |
| **Turnaround Date** | TargetReturnDate | Date display with rush indicator, shows expected turnaround from SubmissionItems |

## Configuration

### App Settings

Configuration stored in SharePoint **Configuration** list:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `azureFunctionUrl` | string | - | Azure Function endpoint for permissions |
| `maxFileSizeMB` | number | 250 | Max file upload size |
| `enablePhase2RequestTypes` | boolean | false | Enable Phase 2 features |

### Submission Types

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**Issue**: TypeScript errors after pulling latest
**Solution**:
```bash
npm run clean
gulp bundle
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Issue**: SCSS type files missing
**Solution**: Run `gulp bundle` to regenerate *.scss.ts files

### Runtime Errors

**Issue**: "SPContext is not initialized"
**Solution**: Ensure `SPContext.smart()` called in extension's `onInit()`

**Issue**: "Access Denied" errors
**Solution**:
1. Check SharePoint permissions
2. Verify Azure Function is running
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for permissions to propagate

### Type Errors

**Issue**: Import errors for spfx-toolkit
**Solution**: spfx-toolkit is linked locally via `npm link` - verify symlink exists in node_modules/

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Change detection (only send modified fields)
- Parallel CAML queries
- Progress tracking for uploads
- Error isolation (document errors don't fail request save)
- Atomic operations (documents upload after request save)

### Known Limitations
- Sequential approval file loading (optimization opportunity)
- Always reloads after save (could be conditional)
- Hardcoded 1.5s delay for rename operations

See [Sequences Documentation](./docs/technical-notes/sequences.md) for detailed performance analysis.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (Azure DevOps)

The project includes Azure Pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment.

### Pipeline Location
- **SPFx Solution**: `.azure-pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml`
- **Deploy Template**: `.azure-pipelines/templates/deploy-spfx.yml`
- **Azure Functions**: `docs/functions/.azure-pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml`

### SPFx Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Trigger | Actions |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Build & Test** | All branches, PRs | Type check, unit tests, build, package |
| **Deploy Dev** | `develop` branch | Deploy to Dev App Catalog |
| **Deploy Prod** | `main` branch | Deploy to Prod App Catalog |

### Pipeline Features
- **npm caching** for faster builds
- **TypeScript type checking** as quality gate
- **Jest unit tests** with JUnit reporting
- **Code coverage** with Cobertura reports
- **Automatic .sppkg packaging** for releases
- **PnP PowerShell deployment** with certificate authentication
- **Pre/post deployment scripts** for custom deployment logic

### Prerequisites for Deployment

1. **Variable Groups** in Azure DevOps:
   - `LegalWorkflow-SPFx-Dev` (development)
   - `LegalWorkflow-SPFx-Prod` (production)

2. **Required Variables**:
   | Variable | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | `spoTenant` | SharePoint tenant (e.g., `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`) |
   | `spoAppId` | Azure AD App Registration Client ID |
   | `spoAppCatalogUrl` | App Catalog URL |
   | `spoCertificateName` | Name of certificate in ADO Secure Files |
   | `spoCertificatePassword` | Certificate password (if applicable) |

3. **Azure AD App Registration** with:
   - `Sites.FullControl.All` application permission
   - Certificate authentication

4. **Secure Files** in ADO Library:
   - Upload the .pfx certificate file

### Deployment Scripts

The pipeline supports pre/post deployment scripts located in `Deployments/{version}/`:

```
Deployments/
└── 0.0.1/
    ├── pre.deploy.ps1   # Runs before deployment
    └── post.deploy.ps1  # Runs after deployment
```

Scripts receive parameters: `-Environment`, `-Tenant`, `-SiteUrl`, `-Version`

Use cases:
- **pre.deploy.ps1**: Backup config, validate prerequisites, provision lists
- **post.deploy.ps1**: Apply PnP templates, send notifications, validate deployment

### Manual Deployment

If not using automated deployment:
```bash
# Build and package
npm run release

# Output: sharepoint/solution/legal-workflow.sppkg
# Upload manually to SharePoint App Catalog
```

---

## Security

### Authentication
- Uses SPFx context authentication
- No additional login required
- Supports MFA and conditional access

### Authorization
- Item-level permissions via Azure Functions
- Role-based access control
- Permission inheritance broken on status change

### Data Protection
- All data stored in SharePoint Online
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Audit logging via SharePoint versioning
